            This code of conduct outlines our expectations for participants
            within the Tampa Devs community (relevant to both our Slack and
            Meetup), as well as steps to reporting unacceptable behavior. We are
            committed to providing a welcoming and inspiring community for all
            and expect our code of conduct to be honored. Anyone who violates
            this code of conduct may be banned from the community.
          </p>

          <p>Our community strives to:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Be friendly and patient.</strong>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Be welcoming:</strong> We strive to be a community that
              welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities.
              This includes, but is not limited to members of any race,
              ethnicity, culture, national origin, color, immigration status,
              social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual
              orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family
              status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical
              ability.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Be considerate:</strong> Your actions (and words) affect
              users and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into
              account. Remember that we're a very diverse community, so you
              might not be communicating in someone else's primary language.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Be respectful:</strong> Not all of us will agree all the
              time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor
              manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then,
              but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal
              attack. It's important to remember that a community where people
              feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Be careful in the words that we choose:</strong> we are a
              community of professionals, and we conduct ourselves
              professionally. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other
              participants. Harassment and other exclusionary behavior aren't
              acceptable.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Try to understand why we disagree:</strong> Disagreements,
              both social and technical, happen all the time. It is important
              that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively.
              Remember that we're different. The strength of our community comes
              from its diversity, people from a wide range of backgrounds.
              Different people have different perspectives on issues. Being
              unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn't mean
              that they're wrong. Don't forget that it is human to err and
              blaming each other doesn't get us anywhere. Instead, focus on
              helping to resolve issues and learning from mistakes.
            </li>

          <h2>Diversity Statement</h2>
          <p>
            We encourage everyone to participate and are committed to building a
            community for all. Although we will fail at times, we seek to treat
            everyone both as fairly and equally as possible. Whenever a
            participant has made a mistake, we expect them to take responsibility
            for it. If someone has been harmed or offended, it is our
            responsibility to listen carefully and respectfully, and do our best
            to right the wrong.
          </p>

          <p>
            Although this list cannot be exhaustive, we explicitly honor
            diversity in age, gender, gender identity or expression, culture,
            ethnicity, language, national origin, political beliefs, profession,
            race, religion, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and
            technical ability. We will not tolerate discrimination based on any
            of the protected characteristics above, including participants with
            disabilities.
          </p>

            make a decision as to how to respond. If the person who is harassing
            you is part of the response team, they will recuse themselves from
            handling your incident. If the complaint originates from a member of

            response team. We will respect confidentiality requests for the
            purpose of protecting victims of abuse.

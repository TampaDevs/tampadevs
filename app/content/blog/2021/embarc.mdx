We're announcing our partnership with [Embarc Collective](https://www.embarccollective.com/), a startup hub in downtown Tampa!

How it started:

I (Vincent) randomly met with one of my neighbors in my apartment complex. I was wearing one of our new Tampa Devs shirts. We had a conversation, and next thing
that happened he connected me with Allie over at Embarc Collective. From there, I was placed in touch with Evan at Embarc Collective.

Haritha and I met Evan in-person and we partnered to host future events over at Embarc!

What this means for Tampa Devs!

- More awesome events!
- Collaboration with the startup community in town
- Startup of the year conference, [https://startupofyear.com](https://startupofyear.com)

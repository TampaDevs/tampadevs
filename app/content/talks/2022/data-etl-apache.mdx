## Talk1: Data ETL with Apache Airflow

In an age of data revolution, Ryan Hatter will be giving a speech about using the powers of Apache Airflow to make the most of data.

Data powers business critical processes such as analytics and artificial intelligence applications ranging from e-commerce recommendations to self-driving cars, but before those applications are possible, data must first be made usable. We'll discuss why data orchestration is an important means to that end, and we'll talk about how Apache Airflow makes data orchestration possible at scale.

Speaker Bio: Ryan Hatter is a Senior Airflow Engineer at Astronomer, the driving force behind Apache Airflow™. In addition to his work on Airflow, he's worked in various data engineering roles at Deloitte and Nielsen, and he co-led the the development of Iron Mountain's Enterprise Data Warehouse

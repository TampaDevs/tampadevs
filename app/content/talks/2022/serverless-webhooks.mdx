Professionally, Chris is the CTO of a local technology company called "Relativity", where he and his talented engineering team build automation-enabled software products.

## Talk2 - Serverless Functions

Jackson will be a talk on serverless functions! And the differnet tools in the AWS environment to set this up!

## PARKING LOGISTICS:

Just an FYI, this is the address for the other ReliaQuest office near the international mall, not the one on harbour island

There is a large parking garage attached to this building, attendees can park anywhere in the garage and this does not require any parking validation.

Our office is on the third floor, so just take the elevators up! The doors downstairs may lock, so we will have someone downstairs to monitor and let everyone in.

Suite 300

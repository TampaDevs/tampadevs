## DevOps - Automate Everything

Modern deployment of applications require both security and availability. This used to mean owning local servers but has since moved to cloud platforms such as AWS. This carries many benefits but requires learning a lot of new tooling. So, join us to learn the ins and outs of getting an application hosted which can serve millions of requests. This will include a broad overview of DevOps as well as an in depth tech demo featuring:

Terraform
AWS
Linux
Docker
Github Actions
and lots of command line usage!

BIO: Douglas Moore has worked DevOps for both large and small companies. Loves to learn full stack development with React (Next.js) on the side. Currently pursuing his masters in Computer Science at Georgia Tech.

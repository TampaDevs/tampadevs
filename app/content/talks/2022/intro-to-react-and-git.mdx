We're hosting our first technical talk of the year! This talk is in partnership with ReactJS Tampa and will be held be at [ReliaQuest](https://reliaquest.com) over in Harbour Island. You can watch it remotely through zoom - we'll post a link in the comments around that time

ALSO, if you do attend, there will be Fresh Kitchen for catering too!

## Talk1 - Introduction to React

React is a JavaScript library meant to supercharge HTML programming. It's one of the most popular front-end 'frameworks', yet learning it can be confusing. We'll explore some basics as well as some tooling. The goal of the discussion is to go from zero to hero. Open to developers of all skillsets.

## PARKING LOGISTICS:

Parking and finding the office can be found here:

[https://www.reliaquest.com/wp-content/uploads/reliaquest-office-parking-instructions.pdf](https://www.reliaquest.com/wp-content/uploads/reliaquest-office-parking-instructions.pdf)

For parking, please pull a ticket at the gate upon entering the garage. You will need to keep the ticket that you pull at the entrance gate to exit the garage. When exiting, the ticket that is pulled at your arrival must be scanned at the reader first and then you can scan the validation ticket you receive from us during your stay to cover the cost.

The South doors next to the security desk will be unlocked for the event and that is how you will enter the building.

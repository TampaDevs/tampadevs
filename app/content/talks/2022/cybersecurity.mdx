## Details

We're hosting our another software tech talk at ReliaQuest's West Tampa location! You can watch it remotely through zoom - we'll post a link in the comments around that time
ALSO, if you do attend, there will be Fresh Kitchen for catering too!

## PARKING LOGISTICS:

This event is at the ReliaQuest office near the International Mall (not the one on Harbour Island).

There is a large parking garage attached to this building, attendees can park anywhere in the garage and this does not require any parking validation.

Our office is on the third floor, so just take the elevators up! The doors downstairs may lock, so we will have someone downstairs to monitor and let everyone in.
Suite 300

Over the last few events, we have been collaborating with [ReactJS Tampa](https://www.meetup.com/ReactJS-Tampa-Bay/). 

Because of the great success we've had together, we've agreed to merge it together with TampaDevs

What this means:

- We'll be hosting more awesome events as always!
- There will be more topics besides ReactJS in future talks moving forward
- We'll be using the tampa devs slack as a joined community
- Events will be posted on both channels, but Tampa Devs will be the primary

Excited to see y'all at the next event!

Hey we're official announcing our partnership with TADHacks hackathon!

[TADHacks](https://tadhack.com/2022) is a global telecommunications hackathon. There are locations around the country, and Tampa is it's newest location!

We'll be organizing logistics with our partnership with [ReliaQuest](https://reliaquest.com) as well for venue support.

And continuing partnerships with USF Hackabull / [SHPE](https://bullsconnect.usf.edu/shpe/home/) to have students come out to win swag/prizes/learn something new!

Here's the link to the partners page on TADHacks

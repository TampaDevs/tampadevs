We're thrilled to announce that we're now officially a 501c3 nonprofit!

A heartfelt thank you goes out to each and every one of you who played a part in making this a reality. We never anticipated establishing a nonprofit with Tampa Devs, yet here we are!

We filed our application on November 15, 2022, and to our pleasant surprise, received approval much sooner than expected!

Being a 501c3 nonprofit opens up a wealth of opportunities for Tampa Devs.

One key advantage is that donors and companies can now enjoy tax write-offs when they support us. Additionally, we can now apply more easily for government grants. This funding will enable us to host larger scale events such as hackathons and engaging workshops that we've planned for later this year.

Moreover, as a nonprofit, we have access to discounts (sometimes even freebies!) on a wide range of SaaS tools. We're talking about a potential 15% off across the board, which includes heavy hitters like GSuite, Shopify, Google/Azure credit, TechSoup, and more. These tools will greatly enhance our community organizing capabilities and overall productivity.

On top of all that, we're eligible to apply for a tax exemption form, which could mean no taxes on items like merchandise and, perhaps, even food.

In essence, our new status empowers us to do more, and to do it more effectively. This propels us closer to the objectives outlined in our mission statement and values.

Stay tuned for more exciting updates at our next meetup! Achieving our nonprofit status marks just the beginning of our journey, and we can't wait to see where it leads us.

## Benefits of giving a talk

Also if you do a talk your also welcome to do intro talks for upcoming meetups!

Topics are anything a software developer might want to know. Past topics we've done are on React, Git, DevOps, Game Dev, Typescript, IoT, Cloud architecture, etc to give some examples. We're always open to new ideas or do similar talks to ones we've done in the past

Non-specific software topics like SEO, entreuprenuership, life skills, UX design, etc are also welcome too!
